## What is GenEris?

GenEris is a CLI tool that allows you to generate a Discord bot project in a matter of seconds. The library that GenEris **ONLY** support is [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha).

## Why GenEris?

If you're a lazy developer who wants things fast and efficient, GenEris serves everything for you! 

Please keep in mind that if you're new to coding, we don't recommend to use GenEris since [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) itself isn't too beginner friendly.

## GenEris is NOT:

- Library
- Framework
